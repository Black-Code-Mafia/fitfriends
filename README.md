Finding Activity
- Search by Category
- Search by Location
- Expressing interest

Screen 1 - Slide view, like home of Twitter
- View 1 -  Social, whats going on around us?
- View 2 - Creating an event / or search by category [Reasoning: the input information]
	- Search should go by category and then by tag.
	- Categories are pre-defined by our app, should show as first result if search string is matching
	- If user continues to type, then give option to create new if nothing matches


Other Notes:

- Post a topic [IE Basketball, 3v3! Need 1 more!]
- Topics create a conversation between all those interested. Host sets time limit for topic to be published for. If event requirements are filled, can unpublish topic.
- Target college campuses, easy source of a large amount of people in a small area for geo-location
- Let user expand location search and narrow location search to specific areas. Default to what is around you.
